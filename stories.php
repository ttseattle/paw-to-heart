                    We thought we lost it all when the hurricane hit. Our home was destroyed, none of our family heirlooms were salvageable, and we thought we would never see our girl Snowball ever again. After settling into a safe place, we called everyone on our contact list to ask if they had seen our girl. We got one no after another, and lost just about all hope...but then we found paw to heart. They made it so easy to connect with the kind strangers who took our girl in. We are absolutely ecstatic to have our girl back home, and have paw to heart to thank for bringing our family back together!
